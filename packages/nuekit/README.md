## Standards first web framework

Nue is a web framework focused on web standards, currently in active development. Our goal is to expose the hidden complexity that's become a norm in modern web development. When a single button weighs more than an entire application, something is clearly broken.

Nue makes the inevitable shift. We're rebuilding the entire ecosystem from scratch, with a cleaner, more efficient core. Our goal is to restore the joy of web development for all key skillsets: frontend architects, design engineers, and UX engineers.


### What this means

1. **Build apps with a fraction of the code**: The apps are literally smaller than a single React button. Modern web standards are beasts.

3. **Rust computation engines**: Write clean, isolated business models where the performance critical parts can be offloaded to Rust or Go.

1. **Faster HMR and tooling**: Instant HMR for all asset types: content, styling, data, and components. Build large applications in milliseconds.
