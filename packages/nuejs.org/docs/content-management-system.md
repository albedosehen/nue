# Content Management System
Nue comes with a flat-file content management system for marketers, copywrites, and technical writers. All your pages, from rich landing pages to simple blog entries can be assembled in such way that the content is in the forefront and ditable by non-technical people.

All content supports hot-reloading: just edit your content and see the page shaping up in your browser in real time.


### Text-based Notion
Nue offers a rich *Markdown* and *Wordpress* inspired content format for assembling web pages of any complexity. It's like Notion, but editable with your favorite text editor.

This is different from frameworks like *Next.js* or *Astro* where the more complex pages are written with *TypeScript* or *JavaScript*:
