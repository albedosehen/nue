# Web framework for UX developers
Nue is a web framework for UX developers. You can rapidly turn your idea into a beautifully designed website without a complex designer-developer handoff process in the way. The result is beautifully designed not just from the outside, but from the inside as well.

Nue's [development flow](ux-development.html) focuses solely on the ~user experience~ because that's the only thing that matters in design. Or as the master UX developer **Steve Jobs** once said:

> You've got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology, not the other way around. *Steve Jobs • UX developer*

## Target audience
Nue is a great fit for the following people:

1. **UX developers**: who prefer to jump to CSS directly from **Figma** or **Sketch** without a [complex](//medium.com/design-warp/5-most-common-designer-developer-handoff-mishaps-ba96012be8a7) and time-consuming designer-developer handoff process in the way.

2. **Beginner web developers**: who want to skip the redundant layers in the [frontend stack](//roadmap.sh/frontend) and start building websites quickly with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

3. **Experienced JS developers**: who are frustrated with the absurd amount of layers in the [React stack](//roadmap.sh/react) and look for simpler ways to develop modern websites.


## Key features and benefits


### Less but better code
What used to take a UI designer, React engineer, and an absurd amount of JavaScript can now be done by a UX developer and just a handful of CSS:

With Nue, you can take advantage of a [global design system](global-design-system.html)  and [modern CSS](css-best-practises.html) to build websites with significantly less code than what you need with a JavaScript-based framework like **Next.js**.

Nue changes the way you think about web development. Chances are that you become a professional UX developer or "design engineer" focusing on _both_ design and CSS.


### New levels of performance
If there is one word to describe Nue, it's _minimalism_. There's order of magnitude less of everything: be it source code, NPM modules, API methods, or the amount of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Just take any professionally-designed website and compare it with Nue, and you'll see the difference. For example:

With Nue, the size of your website is usually so small, that it's in the ballpark of a [single Tailwind button](/blog/introducing-nue-css/). You can reach the performance levels of a text-only website like [motherfuckingwebsite.com](//motherfuckingwebsite.com/) but with the design standards of **Stripe** or **Apple**.

But that's not all. Nue takes your website performance to new heights by combining your assets into [one, ultra-compact request](performance-optimization.html) which renders in a snap:

This is literally the fastest you can get. No matter how clever your **Turbopack** or **Vite** is, they can never beat a single, compact request that has everything to render the page.



### Advanced motion and reactivity
With Nue, things like view transitions and scroll-linked animations are easy to implement with nothing but CSS:

```
/* view transition: scale down the "old" page */
::view-transition-old(root) {
  transform: scale(.8);
  transition: .4s;
}
```

For more advanced reactivity you can [progressively enhance](reactivity.html) the experience with JavaScript. Depending on your need you can choose the best technology for the job: reactive island, isomorphic component, Web Component, or vanilla JavaScript.



### Timeless skills and products
Nue is the best framework to work with the [web standards](//www.w3.org/wiki/The_web_standards_model_-_HTML_CSS_and_JavaScript): HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The code you writing now is something that all developers can understand — now and in the future. There is no fear of becoming outdated because these standards are forever.

Learn the power of CSS and stay relevant for the decades to come.


### Easy customer handoff
No matter how rich and complex your page is, it can be assembled with an easy-to-write content format suitable for non-technical people:

Nue takes the maintenance care off your shoulders. You can hand a finished website to your customers and they can move forward without your constant help.

Nue is a perfect system for freelancers and design agencies who want to offer the best-in-breed websites with an easy way to manage content.


### Try it
You might not believe all the big claims until you [give Nue a try](installation.html). Chances are that you will start wondering why you have ever built websites in any other way.
