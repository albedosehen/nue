# Why Nue?
Nue is a design engineering framework with unmatched performance, simplicity, and a user-focused development model. Here’s why it could be a great fit for your next project:

## 1. Tooling
Nue's server-side renderer (SSR) is purpose-built for maximum build speed and HMR performance. It detects changes across all assets—content, data, layouts, styles, and components—and instantly applies them in real-time with a highly efficient diff and patch system.

Nue’s hot module reloading (HMR) and build times are among the fastest available, consistently outperforming popular frameworks like Next.js:

  Framework   |  Next.js      |  Nue
  NPM modules  |  300+         |  10+
  Project weight |  300M+        |  10M+
  Build speed / 10 pages |  10+ seconds  |  0.01+s
  Build speed / 100 pages |  10+ seconds  |  0.01+s
  Hot-reload times / complex app |  1 - 5s       |  0.05 - 0.3s

## 2. Coding
Nue is built on **progressive enhancement**, fundamentally transforming how websites are developed. What once required a React specialist and extensive TypeScript effort can now be achieved with a concise, standards-based codebase. Instead of navigating engineering complexities, you’ll be free to focus on **design, usability, accessibility**, and **SEO**:

## Who Is Nue Good For?
Nue is a great fit for:

1. **Beginner web developers**: Those looking to bypass [frontend redundancy](//roadmap.sh/frontend) and work directly with the Web Standard Model: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. **Experienced JavaScript developers**: Those frustrated with the overwhelming amount of abstractions in the [React stack](//roadmap.sh/react) and seeking simpler ways to develop professional websites.

3. **Design-focused teams**: Those prioritizing user experience and design systems, leveraging modern CSS to create efficient, lightweight websites that enhance usability without the bloat of JS monoliths.

Overall, if you’re looking to build beautiful and innovative websites with faster tooling and a simpler development model, then Nue is the right choice for you.



## Terminology
Key terms mentioned in this article:

[define]
  #### Hot reloading
  A feature that instantly applies changes across all asset types—content, data, layouts, styles, and components—for faster, smoother development.

  #### Turbolinking
  A technique that speeds up navigation by loading pages with AJAX, enabling faster transitions without full page reloads.

  #### View transitions
  A feature that provides smooth visual transitions between different states or pages, enhancing user experience with fluid navigation.

  #### Interactive islands
  A design pattern that allows specific sections of a page to be interactive while the rest remains static, enhancing performance and user experience.

  #### JS monoliths
  JavaScript bundles that pack numerous features into a single file, often leading to complexity, reduced clarity, and maintenance challenges.
