  NPM modules                       |  300+          |  10+
  Project weight                    |  300M+         |  10M+
  Build speed / 10 pages            |  10+ seconds   |  0.01+ seconds
  Build speed / 100 pages           |  30+ seconds   |  0.1+ seconds
  Hot-reload times / complex app    |  1 - 5s        |  0.05 - 0.3s

## 2. Coding
Nue is built on **progressive enhancement**, fundamentally transforming how websites are developed. What once required a **React specialist** and extensive **TypeScript** effort can now be achieved with a concise, standards-based codebase, allowing you to focus on what matters: **content**, **layout**, **design**, and **motion**.

Surprisingly, these rich, interactive sites remain exceptionally lightweight, comparable to text-only websites. Here’s how this documentation area compares to Next.js documentation:

  Resources         | Next.js   | Nue      | Difference
  HTML document     | 51kB      | 10kB     | 10 × smaller
  CSS               | 62kB      | 1kB      | 62 × less
  JavaScript        | 531kB     | 7kB      | 75 × less
  Total             | 644kB     | 19kB     | 34 × less

## Who Is Nue Good For?
Nue is a great fit for:

1. **Beginner web developers**: Those looking to bypass [frontend redundancy](//roadmap.sh/frontend) and work directly with the Web Standard Model: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. **Experienced JavaScript developers**: Those frustrated with the overwhelming amount of abstractions in the [React stack](//roadmap.sh/react) and seeking simpler ways to develop professional websites.

3. **Design-focused teams**: Those prioritizing user experience and design systems, leveraging modern CSS to create efficient, lightweight websites that enhance usability without the bloat of JS monoliths.

If you’re looking to build beautiful and innovative websites with faster tooling and a simpler development model, **Nue is the right choice for you**.
