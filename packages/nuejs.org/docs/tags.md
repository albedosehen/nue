## Built-in tags
List of all built-in tags for [content authors](content.html)


## Tag syntax
A "tag" is a Markdown extensions that allows the vocabularity of content authors to create rich web pages. The usage is pretty simple. Letâ€™s say we want to add a video, we could write something like this:

``` md
[video /videos/explainer.mp4]
```

A tag starts with a square bracket, followed with a tag name and options.


### Options
Tag options can be supplied in several ways:


``` md
// named options
[image src="hello.png" caption="Hello, World" alt="Hello image"]

// nested options
[image]
  caption: Hello, World!
  large: hello-big.png
  small: hello.png
  alt: Hello Image

// plain value without the attribute name
[image hello.png]

// handy syntax for id and class attributes
[image#hero-image.heroic hero.webp]
```

### Nested content
Most tags like images, buttons, tabs, and grids accept nested content:

```
[image explainer.png]
  This nested content is the caption for the image. You can add Markdown here like *emphasis* and `inline code`
```




## Built-in tags

### Image
Renders an image with optional caption. For example:

```
[image hello.webp]
  This content here is the caption. Markdown *formatting* is supported
```

Shortcut alias (!) is supported:

```
[! hello.webp]
```

Images can link to URL's with `href` attribute:

```
[! book.svg href="/docs/" caption="View documentation"]
```

[Art direction](//web.dev/articles/codelab-art-direction) is supported:

```
[! small="ui-tall.png" large="ui-wide.png" ]
```

[Responsive images](//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) are supported

```
