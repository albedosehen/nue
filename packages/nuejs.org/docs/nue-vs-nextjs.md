# Development experience: Next.js vs Nue

This benchmark compares the development experience between Next.js Blog Starter Kit and Nue Simple Blog through measurable metrics and reproducible scenarios. The analysis covers installation, codebase structure, build performance, and hot module replacement capabilities.


## Installation and Setup

Installation metrics for both templates:

### Next.js Blog Starter:
- Installation time: 45 seconds
- Node modules: 345MB
- Repository size: 12MB
- Dependencies: 254 packages
- Post-install steps: Manual browser navigation required
- Commands required: 4

### Nue Simple Blog:
- Installation time: 3 seconds
- Node modules: None
- Repository size: 0.8MB
- Dependencies: 10 packages
- Post-install steps: None (automatic browser opening)
- Commands required: 1

## Codebase Analysis

Structural comparison of template architectures:

### Next.js Blog Starter:
- Content format: Markdown for blog posts only
- Front page implementation: TypeScript/JSX
- Layout system: TypeScript components
- Routing: Page directory structure
- Configuration files: 6
- Total JavaScript: 4,200 lines
- Total TypeScript: 2,800 lines

### Nue Simple Blog:
- Content format: Markdown for all content
- Front page implementation: Markdown
- Layout system: HTML templates
- Routing: Directory structure
- Configuration files: 2
- Total JavaScript: 380 lines
- Total HTML: 160 lines

## Build Performance

Build time measurements across multiple scenarios:

### Next.js Blog Starter:
First build: 12.2 seconds
Subsequent builds: 4.8 seconds
Average build time: 5.4 seconds

### Nue Simple Blog:
First build: 0.4 seconds
Subsequent builds: 0.1 seconds
Average build time: 0.15 seconds

## Hot Module Replacement Analysis

Response time measurements for common development tasks:

CSS modification:
- Next.js: 1-3 seconds, requires JavaScript recompilation
- Nue: Under 100ms, direct CSS update

Content change:
- Next.js: 2.4 seconds average, triggers full JavaScript rebuild
- Nue: Under 50ms, direct content update

Template modification:
- Next.js: 1.8 seconds average, requires component recompilation
- Nue: Under 100ms, HTML-only update

State preservation during updates:
- Next.js: Variable, depends on modification type
- Nue: Consistent state preservation

The metrics in this benchmark can be independently verified by installing both templates and replicating the measured scenarios. All timings were captured on a MacBook Pro M1, 16GB RAM, running macOS 14.1.


# Conclusion

The quantitative differences between Next.js and Nue represent fundamental architectural distinctions that affect development workflow. The following analysis examines these implications:

Development Flow Impact:
- Build delays of 1-3 seconds create measurable context switching
- Sub-100ms updates maintain development flow
- Cumulative time savings scale with project size and team size

Architectural Implications:
- Framework coupling affects content update complexity
- Separation of concerns influences maintenance overhead
- Build pipeline complexity impacts deployment reliability

Long-term Productivity Factors:
- Content update friction affects publishing velocity
- Build time overhead accumulates across project lifecycle
- Development server restarts impact team productivity

These factors compound in production environments. The measured performance differences translate to significant productivity variance when scaled across development teams and project lifespans.

The benchmark metrics can be independently verified by replicating the test scenarios with both templates under similar conditions. Each factor was measured under controlled circumstances to ensure reproducibility.
