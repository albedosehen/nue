# Theming
Bring our design system to life. From global elements to details

! Globals
  Libraries
  Areas
  Pages (sections.css)



### Globals
  Colors, Typography -> Global Ccomponents (Navigation)


### Libraries
  Components that are needed on different areas of your site
  For example: components that are used in both the documentation area and blog content, but not necessarily on your marketing areas: syntax highlighting, typographical elements, info boxes..
  Separate components from globals

### Areas
  Use the cascade to your advantage
  Blog, Documentation,
  Mostly layout code and area-specific components.
  Don't override things on the design system
  This is often the place where most of your CSS resides.


### Pages
  ...
  When starting with a new website, you have everything in control.
  Front page is ofthen a special case.
