Global design system (GDS) is a styling framework to turn your personal design system into a functional website:

Nue offers a headless set of page layouts and components so that implementing a website reduces to creating your personal theme with Nue's powerful styling framework. Think of it like a modern-day [CSS Zen Garden](//www.csszengarden.com/) but after 20 years of advancement CSS and web technologies.

  Global Design System improves the quality and accessibility of the world’s web experiences, save the world’s web designers and developers millions of hours, and make better use of our collective human potential.


## Shift in focus
Nue shifts you from building hundreds of site-specific React components to creating a personal design system that is effectively propagated to all areas on your website:

Your job, as UX developer, is to convert the headless layouts in the global design system to match the rules on your personal design system.


### Control for designers
Nue gives control back to design professionals who natively think in terms of a centrally manged design system. Disabling local/inline styling keeps things in the hands of a UX developer and ensures consistent look and feel accross the board.

### Less to manage
A centrally managed system reduces the amount of code you need to manage. This single source of truth maximizes code re-usability and minimizes duplication. You can easily end up in a situation where you have 10-100x less code than in a system where the styling code is distributed into components with no shared CSS.
