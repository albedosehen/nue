# Global Design System

## CSS Zen Garden
Nue layout system is a modern-day [CSS Zen Graden](//csszengarden.com/). For those old enough to remember, it was a demonstration of what can be accomplished through CSS-based design. You always get the same layout for your pages and components, but the design can change wildly just by using a different stylesheet.

Nue layout system is exactly the same idea, and extends it with the following

1. Standard's based HTML layouts for most common scenarios: blog entries, documentation entries, index pages, and rich freeform layouts like the front page. Modern Semantic HTML elements, not available in the era of Zen Garden.

1. Component library. A growing set. Focusing on content-heavy websites, and later expanding to SPA's as well. Perfected with accessibility guidelines. The HTML code in the standard componetns follow closely W3C..


1. Reactivity layyer: Complete web experiences with view transitions, web components, and reactive components.  after 20 years of advancement CSS and web technologies.

Global design system (GDS) is a styling framework to turn your personal design system into a functional website:

## Shift in focus
Nue shifts you from building hundreds of site-specific React components to creating a personal design system that is effectively propagated to all areas on your website:

Your job, as UX developer, is to convert the headless layouts in the global design system to match the rules on your personal design system.


### Control for designers
Nue gives control back to design professionals who natively think in terms of a centrally manged design system. Disabling local/inline styling keeps things in the hands of a UX developer and ensures consistent look and feel accross the board.

### Less to manage
A centrally managed system reduces the amount of code you need to manage. This single source of truth maximizes code re-usability and minimizes duplication. You can easily end up in a situation where you have 10-100x less code than in a system where the styling code is distributed into components with no shared CSS.
