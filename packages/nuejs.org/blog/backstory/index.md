I still remember the exact moment when I discovered jQuery. It was a revelation: can I suddenly add logic to my pages in the same way I add styling? Oh yeah — This is going to be huge!

And it was: in the following years we got introduced to groundbreaking concepts like *separation of concerns*, *semantic HTML*, and *progressive enhancement*. Things were great.


## Then it changed { #then }

Developers discovered *React* and single-page applications, and *Facebook* started to dictate web development. Slowly but steadily *JavaScript developers* took control of everything: logic, layout, styling, and UX development. And content-heavy websites were developed like they were single-page apps. Eventually, JS engineers won, [UX developers][divide] lost, and the old foundation was gone.


## But the magic is still there { #magic }

First, we must recognize that a content-focused website is a whole different beast than a single-page application. Secondly, we need to understand that UX development is a whole [different field][brad] from JS development. The goals, skillsets, and interests are different.


Nue is an ambitious attempt to fix the status quo. It offers drastically simpler tooling for both JS and UX developers. It brings back the [content-first approach](/) to web development. It makes web development enjoyable again.

Nue is the frontend troublesolver you've been looking for.
