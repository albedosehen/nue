    At some point in the last decade, popular frameworks and platforms have eschewed semantic markup, and, as a result, the web has become way more bloated than it ever needed to be. Stripping away presentational markup and unreadable CSS is something all web developers once believed in. I'm glad Nue is bringing back that power.

    text: Love what you are doing with the project, thank you! I also have a big passion for making the web a simpler place for developers. I work as a front-end developer by day, using React, and I've thought over and over again, surely there must be a better, simpler way. So thank you!

    text: Wow. I am so much loving the concepts you guys have introduced in Nue CSS and Nue Kit and all your projects are amazing. I am really falling in love with all of the projects.

    text: It's so wonderful to hear someone espouse the benefits of semantic CSS over all of this "utility-first" nonsense. I understand the draw of Tailwind but there's just so much overhead and the learning curve is steep. And if you're working with Tailwind all of the time, you'll forget what items-center means in CSS. Excited to follow Nue!

    text: I just found your site, and am excited about the concepts of content first, separation of concern, and everything else. I have been looking and waiting for the RAD version of web development. Maybe Nue is it? Also, as a fellow Scandinavian, Finnish design doesn't hurt. Good luck forward!

    text: It's funny how React and other frameworks spent so much effort abstracting the render loop, meanwhile Nue is just like "call update()". And in the end, Nue looks a lot simpler to use.
