  At some point in the last decade, popular frameworks and platforms have eschewed semantic markup, and, as a result, the web has become way more bloated than it ever needed to be. Stripping away presentational markup and unreadable CSS is something all web developers once believed in. I'm glad Nue is bringing back that power.
